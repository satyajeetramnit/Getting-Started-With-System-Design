# System Design

## 1. Introduction to System Design

**What is System Design?**

System Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system that satisfies specified requirements. It involves breaking down a large software system into smaller manageable parts, designing their interactions, and creating an architecture that meets the desired quality attributes like performance, scalability, reliability, maintainability, and availability.

**Importance of System Design**

As software systems become more complex and need to handle large amounts of data, traffic, and users, proper system design becomes crucial. A well-designed system can ensure:

- **Scalability**: The ability to handle increased workloads by adding more resources.

- **Availability**: Ensuring the system is operational and can serve users at all times, even during failures or high load.

- **Reliability**: The system should operate continuously without failure and recover gracefully from failures.

- **Efficiency**: Optimal use of computing resources like CPU, memory, disk, and network.

- **Maintainability**: The system should be easy to understand, modify, and extend over time.

- **Manageability**: The system should be easy to monitor, diagnose issues, and apply updates or changes.
